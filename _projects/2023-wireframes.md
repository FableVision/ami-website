This project changed dramatically in the middle of the design sprint but it was an excellent opportunity for the Creaviva team to learn more about the development process, wireframes and paper prototyping. The FableVision team worked closely with members of the Creaviva and Paul Klee Center teams to help them translate their idea for a digital game into visual wireframes. We thought about UX/UI, user pathways and how to build the back-end infrastructure for their game. To test the game, we printed out the paper prototypes and asked players to pretend the paper was a screen. The testing, while rudimentary, was an essential part of the process and proved that the game concept worked while pointing out places that could use attention. Thanks to  the wireframes and paper prototypes, the game will be built digitally this winter.
