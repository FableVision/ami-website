Our goal in this game was to build an “escape room”-type hunt but there were some specific requirements: the game needed to be held outside. It had to be administered without technology and without the use of staff and it needed to be in multiple languages: English, German and French. One of our greatest resources was The Beyeler Foundation’s successful new outdoor Art Cart. We were able to start and end the game at the cart and the result was a visual puzzle-based scavenger hunt around the Beyeler Grounds. Users visit sculptures by following wordless, visual instructions to the location of hidden boxes. The boxes contain the next visual instruction in the form of a stamp that must be inked and added to the visitor’s map. By finding all of the sculptures on the grounds, visitors complete a final secret code to open the last box which is hidden- of course- at the art cart!
