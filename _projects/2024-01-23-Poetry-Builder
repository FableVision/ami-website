The challenge for this game was to create something encouraging visitors to consider, interact with and eventually create poetry related to ragamala paintings. Museum guests in Switzerland might speak French, German, Italian, English, Romansch or something else entirely so a word-based game is a unique challenge! For the Beyeler summer project we had a similar challenge, which we solved by creating a visual language. The solution for the Rietberg Museum was inspired by magnetic poetry and Swiss Toblerone! We first chose a ragamala painting for participants to view. We played the original music created for the ragamala painting and then with three-sided word cards with words in French, English and German, inspired by existing ragamala poetry, we asked participants to arrange the word pyramids to build their own original ragamala poem. The results were fun and collaborative! Some playtesters used all three languages and others focused on building impressionistic poems entirely with their non-native language. It was a fun experience alone or as a group- especially when someone is willing to dramatically recite your final poem!
