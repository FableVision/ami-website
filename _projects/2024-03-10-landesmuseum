Landesmuseum set out to create a game that helped visitors process their thoughts after walking through a challenging exhibit about colonialism. Understanding that so many aspects of daily life are touched by this topic, Fablevision suggested using literal strings of yarn to symbolize its tangled nature. A map was created with a label for each of the subjects explored in the exhibit placed in the center, as well as various images collected by Landesmusuem to represent subjects that may relate to one another. Each of the labels was identified with a color, which matched a string of yarn, and players were encouraged to use the strings to connect the images, and the subjects however they choose. The players also had the opportunity to add pieces of paper with new topics they felt may connect things further, watching as their quiet collaboration grew visitor after visitor. While Fablevision's Boston office created a prototype with only yarn, Landesmuseum also tested using colored markers on paper to make the connections. They also pinned objects representing the subjects discussed in their exhibit. This concept was tested both with local college students and museum professionals
