The Rietberg Museum chose to focus all three of their projects on an upcoming 2024 exhibit about Indian Ragamalas. The Indian Ragamala combines Indian music, poetry, and painting. This first project, the Ragamala Lab, had participants submitting their own reaction to Indian Ragamalas through creative responses on postcards. The intent was to build visibility for the upcoming exhibit by allowing participants to listen and look at the Ragamala and then respond with their own words, poetry, or drawing.
