St. Gallen's aim was to create a prototype that got visitors up and moving throughout their exhibit, "collection fever". After polling visitors about what they personally collected, a student group drew examples of the responses. On the other side of the page, museum educators found an object in the collection that corresponded with the drawn item. We then built 5 games using these double-sided art cards. Game 1: "Museum", visitors placed drawings on a dedicated spot on a wall, creating their own "collection". "Spot it" was Game 2, and the exhibit favorite according to playtesting. Here, visitors compete to match a series of drawings they have on cards with the cards hung up on a wall. Game 3: "Gallery hunt" has visitors find a painting in the gallery from a zoomed snippet. Game 4, "Group It", was also very popular with one player arranging drawings according to a secret category, and another player guessing the category. Game 5: “Eye Spy” for much younger visitors, asked kids to describe a card on the wall and parents had to guess which card it was. The games were tested during “family day” and we found that they did quite well with the 7 to middle school age group but were less successful in attracting very young kids.
