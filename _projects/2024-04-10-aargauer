The Aargauer Kunsthaus wanted to create a special, guided event for kids and families to enjoy as a one-time experience, rather than a permanent game. Their goal was to highlight the entire museum, including hidden locations and less-visited floors. They were also eager to involve the entire team, with in-person staff directly involved in the play experience. 
 
We developed a location-based story hunt, written by the Aargauer team, which featured hidden miniature doors in various museum locations. These doors contained hints that would lead players to surprises and special pieces in the galleries. The Aargauer team was proactive in testing the game in the galleries from the early stages of development and provided valuable feedback, which was implemented by their test on Easter Sunday. The result was a successful playtest that was enjoyed by ten families of visitors. The entire Aargauer team embraced their roles as masked cats, eagles, and explorers, much to the surprise and delight of their local playtesters!
