The goal for this prototype was to make something accessible to all people, even outside the museum. The museum used Instagram to source volunteersâ€™ photos of colors, shapes, and textures found in everyday life and then compiled those images to make an NFT. To build and share the NFT, pillows with QR codes were placed in the parks surrounding the museum so that the larger community could appreciate the collaborative art piece.
