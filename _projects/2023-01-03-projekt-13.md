Fondation Beyeler took this opportunity to target the untapped demographic of young teenagers in their community with “Project 13”. The premise of the project is that a secret society of 13-year-old artists is the secret to the success of Fondation Beyeler. Annually, the undercover “Project 13” team would need to recruit the next cohort of magical 13 year olds through mysterious art challenge cards tucked away in labeled envelopes. Participants had limited supplies and specific directions, such as “Draw what’s in the window, but only use three colors,” to spark their creativity.
