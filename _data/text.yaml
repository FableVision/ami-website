    Three museums, 10 prototypes, 12 months: that’s the hefty goal for Project AMI but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Initiated by the Max Kohler Foundation in Zurich and FableVision Studios in Boston as a way to Embolden, Empower and Connect the coolest art educators in the world, Project AMI (Art + Museums Interacting) aims to explore new, playful possibilities for audience engagement and interactive installations in Switzerland.

    Over 30 day sprints, AMI partner museums build, test, and document original, interactive play-based museum education prototypes. The prototypes are peer-reviewed in on-site professional development get-togethers, shared with the public community for feedback and outreach and our learnings are shared in digital Show+Tells with a wider community. Join us as we explore how to build more open spaces for participation, play and collaboration among the museum-going public but also within our own community of museum professionals. Growing our communities can seem like a large task but every community begins with friends.

    Drei Museen, 10 Prototypen, 12 Monate: Das ist das ehrgeizige Ziel von Project AMI. Und doch ist es nur die Spitze des Eisbergs. Project AMI (Art + Museums Interacting) wurde von der Max Kohler Stiftung in Zürich und den FableVision Studios in Boston initiiert, um begeisterte Kunstvermittler:innen zu ermutigen, zu befähigen und zu vernetzen. Dabei werden neue, spielerische Möglichkeiten der Publikumseinbindung sowie interaktive Installationen in der Schweiz erkundet.

    In 30-tägigen Sprints entwickeln, testen und dokumentieren die AMI-Partnermuseen originelle, interaktive, spielerische Prototypen in der Museumspädagogik. Die Prototypen werden vor Ort unter Fachleuten aus der Kunstvermittlungs- und Museumsbranche, aber auch mit der Öffentlichkeit getestet, um dadurch wertvolle Feedbacks zu erhalten. Die Erkenntnisse werden danach in digitalen Show+Tells mit einer grösseren Community geteilt.

    Entdecken Sie mit Project AMI, wie offenere Räume für Partizipation, Spiel und Zusammenarbeit unter den Museumsbesucher:innen, aber auch innerhalb von Museumsfachleuten schaffen können. Eine Community zu erweitern, kann als grosse Aufgabe erscheinen, und doch beginnt schlussendlich jede aus dem eigenen Freundeskreis heraus.

    Switzerland serves as an exciting new arena for educational innovation thanks to its diverse cultural influences, tight-knit community, and burgeoning museum infrastructure. We’re grateful to Project Ami’s very first three partner museums who bravely established our inaugural 2023 cohort: The Museum Rietberg in Zurich, The Fondation Beyeler in Basel and Creaviva at the Paul Klee Center in Bern along with our special guest museum in the United States, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. These museums have agreed to work with us for three 30-day sprints each (one 30-day sprint for our special guest) and have shown their willingness to dedicate time, talent and support to exploring new kinds of play and interaction in their spaces!

    Our Project Ami objective is to release a new, original prototype for almost every month of the year. The reason for this was manifold: a short build cycle forces us to create things that are simpler and more directed. The thirty day prototype shows us that there is an alternative to spending long cycles thinking (and maybe overthinking) through all of the possible details and lastly, the thirty day cycle lets us fail fast and waste less time on project approaches that don’t resonate with our audiences. Take a look here to see the playable prototypes that our wonderful partner museums have built in 30 days!

why:

    The Max Kohler Foundation in Zurich took a poll of 25 cultural institutions in Switzerland: “If you could dream, what would it take to further unlock the potential of art education?”.

    The answer was a call for more collaborative projects, greater knowledge of what’s happening in other museums, more integration of art education and within the museum programming and the battle cry of educators across the world: Time and Money. Project AMI is a response to this poll. What if art education teams could work with a professional design team to prototype, test and share projects within the museum departments, between other museums and ultimately, with visitors? What if this collaboration could include members from different departments, could share information between museums and focus on making projects that are repeatable and evergreen all while cutting down on R&D time for museum staff? This is our hope for Project AMI: to help push the boundaries of what can be done with visitor engagement making Swiss museums more accessible, fun and engaging.
