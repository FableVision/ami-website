  overview: Project AMI is sponsored by The Max Kohler Foundation, which believes that art has a transformative power to positively impact people and encourage social change. The Kohler Foundation considers it a civic duty to provide as many people as possible, regardless of education, income or place of origin, with access to the transformative power of the arts. What better way to do this than through the transformative, engaging power of play? The structure of Ami’s 30-day prototypes encourages Swiss museum partners to not be dissuaded or discouraged by imperfections but to see iteration as an opportunity to grow, to have fun, to deepen connections with audiences and to find joy in museum experiences.

  overview: |
    Project Ami works with three Swiss Partner museums and one American “Special Guest”. To learn more about our 2023 Project Ami cohort, click here. (link to WHO page)

    Our partner museums work with Project AMI to create three original projects each over the course of 12 months. They choose the time of their project, the team and topic and agree to dedicate internal time and resources to bring the prototype to fruition. Meanwhile, the partner museum’s project is granted full access to the team of designers, artists and developers at FableVision who design and develop the production across the finish line within 30 days for internal testing and to share with museum visitors.
